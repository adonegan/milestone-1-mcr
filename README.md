# My Chemical Romance Official Website

This is a static website for rock band My Chemical Romance. This band formed in 2001 and stopped touring in 2014, however they are back for a short summer tour in Europe. As you can see from the website they have six tour dates coming up. 
They wanted this website created for fans and potential fans to showcase their work and let fans know any news and upcoming events. They also wanted a way for fans to reach them directly.

## UX

This website is for fans, potential fans and is a way anyone can get in touch with the band directly.
On the site, people can listen to audio clips, watch a band interview, see photos of the band, get information about the tour and get in touch.

* As a long-time fan, I want to be kept informed of news and tour information. And this website achieves this with its News section that features upcoming tour dates.
* As a new fan, I want to listen to the band's music and watch videos of previous interviews and music videos. And this website achieves this with its embedded Apple song links and YouTube videos.
* I want to be linked to other social media accounts to see all of their work not listed on the website. And this website achieves this with its social icon links in the footer that take the user to third-party websites.
* As someone who just happens upon the site, I want to know what the band is all about. And this website achieves this with some text about the band and its work in nearly all sections. 
* As a booking agent and promoter, I want to be able to get in touch with this band to play at my event. And this website achieves this with its contact form just before the footer.

## Features

### Existing Features

* Feature 1: Navbar - Allows the user to clearly see what pages are part of the website and can be clicked, which will take them to the section of the page. In mobile view this collapses into a three-bar icon.
* Feature 2: Carousel - Allows the user to see up to three shots of the band in their career to date. This gives the user a view of the band in group form and some performance shots give an idea of what the band is like.
* Feature 3: Round images - Allows the user to identify each member of the current line-up of the band and their names. Users will be able to see each band members' face clearly. The round shape adds variety to a page full of boxes. 
* Feature 4: Audio embeds - Allows the user to clearly see covers of the band's studio albums and hear a 30 second snippet of a song. Users can also get a link to the songs and go to Apple to pay for the songs if they want.
* Feature 5: YouTube videos - Allows the user to watch band members talk about their career and work and to see some of their previous music videos. These videos play on the site so users don't have to click through to YouTube if they don't want to.
* Feature 6: Contact form - Allows the user to get in touch with the band by having users be able to leave a message for the band through email. Users have to add information in the subject line that summarises their message.
* Feature 7: Linked buttons - Allows the user to go to third-party websites by clicking on various buttons on the website. These pages open a new tab so users can still easily come back to the site when they click away.
* Feature 8: Linked social icons - Allows the user to reach other sites managed by the band, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. In this way the user can see how much the band has to offer.

### Features Left to Implement

In the future the band want to be able to sell their merchandise directly from this website, instead of linking to external sites. This can be done by adding a product page and third-party payment options.

## Technologies Used

Below is a list of languages, frameworks, libraries, and other tools used to create and develop this website. 

* HTML5: To structure the website and the content included on the website. Semantic tags were used to make each section and code's used obvious.
* CSS3: To style the features used throughout the website to achieve design and placement targets e.g. adding padding, margins, fonts, and changing colors.
* Bootstrap: To structure the content of the website with the use of containers, rows and columns, aka the grid system, and to make the site responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop views.
* JavaScript / jQuery: To make my page features more dynamic and animated when used. This was particularly relevant for the Carousel feature's movement.
* W3Schools: To search for and use code not featured on Bootstrap, and ultimately to see what options the band have when it comes to adding code to the site.

## Testing

1. Navbar: Go to the website and click each item to go to the right section. You can also do this through mobile. And, as you scroll you can see each section being highlighted in the navbar.
2. Carousel: Go the index page and don't click anything; just watch as the Carousel changes from image to image. You can also note the bars that animate at the bottom of the image.
3. Audio embeds: Go audio clips section and click the red play pill button and you should hear 30 seconds of the song. You can also copy the link or the embed code for the user's own use.
4. YouTube videos: Go to the music video and interview sections and press the square red play button on the videos to play the videos from the website; the videos will not open out to YouTube's main site unless you specify this.
5. Contact form: Go to the contact form section and when you try inputting your name a message will appear giving you the text-type the cell expects. This feature happens for each cell. If you do not fill in a cell you cannot send your message and the Send button tells you this. This is a helpful reminder for users to input all necessary information.
6. Linked buttons: All buttons on the website are linked to pages that will open a new tab. The Buy tickets button will take your to Ticketmaster.ie, the Buy albums button will take you to Apple store, and the Subscribe button will take you to the band's YouTube profile so you can check out more videos.
7. Linked social icons: In the footer there are social buttons which indicate other social media sites the band is affiliated with. When clicked the user will be directed to other sites in a new open tab.
