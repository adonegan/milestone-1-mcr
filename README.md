# My Chemical Romance Official Website

This is a static website for rock band My Chemical Romance. 
This band formed in 2001 and stopped touring in 2014, though they perform on occasion at request. 
They wanted this website created for fans and potential fans to let them know any news and upcoming events.

## UX

This website is for fans, potential fans and is a way anyone can get in touch with the band directly.
On the site, people can listen to recordings, watch band interviews and see photos of the band.

* As a long-time fan, I want to be kept informed of news and tour information.
* As a new fan, I want to listen to the band's music and watch videos of previous interviews.
* As someone who just happens upon the site, I want to know what the band is all about.
* As a booking agent and promoter, I want to be able to get in touch with this band to play at my event.
